Electric cars are a more environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered cars.  There are numerous benefits including reduced greenhouse gas emissions, improved air quality, reduced reliance on fossil fuels, lower operating costs, and technological advancements. While there are concerns about the environmental impact of lithium mining for electric car batteries and the source of the electricity used to charge the cars, the overall benefits of electric cars outweigh the drawbacks.
Probably the most significant benefit of electric cars is their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Greenhouse gasses, produced by anything that burns any type of fuel, contribute to global warming and climate change. Transportation is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, accounting for 29% of total emissions in 2019, according to the EPA. Traditional gasoline-powered cars are a major contributor to these emissions.
In contrast, electric cars produce zero direct emissions. While there are emissions associated with the production of electricity used to power electric cars, they are significantly lower than the emissions produced by gasoline-powered cars. According to a study by the Union of Concerned Scientists, electric cars emit less than half the amount of pollution than gasoline-powered cars over their lifetime, even when accounting for the emissions associated with battery manufacturing and electricity generation.
Furthermore, electric cars are becoming increasingly efficient. Advances in technology have led to improvements in battery life and charging times, as well as increased driving range. As a result, electric cars are now a viable option that more drivers can realistically consider, particularly those who live in urban areas where driving distances are shorter.
	Electric vehicles are also getting much cheaper.   For example, the MSRP of the base model Hyundai Kona is $22,595.  Its electric counterpart, the Hyundai Kona Electric, is $33,500.  This is more expensive than the gas model but much cheaper than electric cars from 5 to 10 years ago, such as the 2008 Tesla Roadster, which sold for $100,000.   
The EV is, unsurprisingly, cheaper to maintain, without oil changes or other engine maintenance.  Assuming 15,000 miles driven per year, the car insurance provider AAA has determined that the gas model of the Kona costs $0.0984 per mile, or $4,428 over a 3 year period, and the electric model costs only $0.0794 per mile, or $3,573 in the same time.
There are other financial benefits to owning an electric car.  Over that same 3-year period, the gas cost of the normal Kona was $5,162, while the charging cost for the electric model was only $2,548.  Another factor to consider is the government tax credits.  The electric Kona is eligible for a $7,500 tax credit, but the traditional Kona isn’t eligible at all, being a gas car.  Altogether, after 3 years, the gas-powered Kona costs $32,185, while the electric Kona costs $32,121, being slightly cheaper than the gas model.
Another significant benefit of electric cars is their ability to improve air quality. Traditional cars emit a variety of pollutants, including nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds, all of which contribute to poor air quality and respiratory problems. In contrast, electric cars produce zero tailpipe emissions, meaning they do not contribute to local air pollution.
The environmental impact of fossil fuels has been understood for years (far longer than we’ve been doing anything about it), and reducing use of non-renewable resources is central for a sustainable future. Electric cars offer a solution to this problem, and others, by reducing the amount of fossil fuels needed to power transportation. Compared to gasoline-powered cars, electric cars consume significantly less fossil fuels per mile traveled.
The use of fossil fuels for transportation is a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and air pollution. Electric cars rely on electricity, which can be generated from a variety of sources, including renewable energy sources like solar and wind power. According to the Union of Concerned Scientists, electric vehicles produce less than half the carbon emissions of gasoline-powered vehicles over their lifetime, even when taking into account the emissions associated with manufacturing and disposing of the batteries.
A comparison of the amount of fossil fuels used by electric and gasoline-powered cars shows a significant difference. A typical gasoline-powered car uses an average of 550 gallons of gasoline per year, which translates to around 10 barrels of crude oil per year. On the other hand, an electric car powered by electricity from the grid uses the equivalent of about 4.4 barrels of crude oil per year, while an electric car powered by renewable energy sources uses no fossil fuels at all.
The use of electric cars can also reduce dependence on foreign oil, which can have national security implications. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, transportation accounts for almost 70% of U.S. oil consumption, and much of that oil is imported from foreign countries. By transitioning to electric cars, the United States can reduce its dependence on foreign oil and increase its energy security.  This helps in case supply cuts off, so it won’t have as much of an impact.
Studies have shown that the benefits of reduced reliance on fossil fuels through the use of electric cars can extend beyond the environment and energy security. A study by the American Lung Association found that reducing the amount of fossil fuels used in transportation can lead to improved public health, as air pollution from fossil fuels can contribute to respiratory problems and other health issues.
While electric cars offer numerous benefits in terms of reduced reliance on fossil fuels, there are also some challenges. One of the main challenges is the need for more charging infrastructure to support electric cars, particularly in areas with limited access to charging stations. However, efforts are underway to address this issue, with governments and private companies investing in the development of new charging infrastructure.
One concern that has been raised about electric cars is the environmental impact of lithium mining for the batteries. Lithium is a key component of the batteries used in electric cars, and mining for lithium can have environmental consequences. However, it is important to consider the environmental impact of lithium mining in the context of the environmental impact of gasoline production.
The production of gasoline involves a complex process that includes oil extraction, transportation, refining, and distribution. Each step of this process has its own environmental impact, from oil spills during extraction to emissions from refineries and transportation. In contrast, the environmental impact of lithium mining is primarily related to land use and water consumption. While these impacts should not be dismissed, they are less severe than the environmental impact of gasoline production.
Efforts are underway to address the environmental impact of lithium mining. Some companies are working to develop more sustainable mining practices, such as using renewable energy sources to power mining operations and reducing water consumption. Additionally, research is being conducted into alternative battery technologies that do not rely on lithium, such as solid-state batteries.
It is also important to consider the potential benefits of electric cars in the context of the environmental impact of lithium mining. As discussed earlier, electric cars produce significantly fewer greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutants than gasoline-powered cars. The reduction in emissions from electric cars can help mitigate the impacts of climate change and improve public health.
In conclusion, while the environmental impact of lithium mining for electric car batteries should not be ignored, it is important to consider this impact in the context of the overall environmental impact of transportation. The benefits of electric cars in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and improved air quality make them a promising alternative to gasoline-powered cars. Efforts are underway to address the environmental impact of lithium mining, and other types of batteries that don’t have lithium are being researched. Overall, electric cars offer a more sustainable and environmentally friendly transportation option for the future.
